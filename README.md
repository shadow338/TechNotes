# TechNotes
Technical Notes on the hardware design &amp; function of various aspects of the TEC-1 and Southern Cross SC-1.

This section is designed to capture information about various aspects of the TEC-1's design that may not be immediately apparent from issues 10-15 alone.
My aim is to both record details such as I/O port & memory maps, port bit assignments, look at design decision decisions and the limitations thereof,
as well as discuss differences between various MONitors and hardware changes over the years.

Some of the less well understood areas such as keyboard handling will be looked at in detail.

Consider this a fine 'second source' for missing details...nothing here is too technical, and is designed to assist hardware developers and programmers alike.

I will also include notes relating to the Southern Cross SC-1 where known and relevant. Whilst the SC-1 and TEC are not directly interchangeable, they are 95% alike and
software can be easily adapted for either platform with a few minor edits (in most cases).

Feel free to ask questions and contribute your own information edits, corrections, updates and additional notes as necessary.
