TEC-1 I/O ports Definitions

For the standard TEC-1x family (1/1A/B/C/D etc) per TE issues 10-15:

If we define 'standard' monitors, as MON1 family & MON 2, then ports 0-2 are defined.
With the DAT board (and JMON), ports 3, 4 & 84h are additinoally define, as follows.

Port 0 - Keyboard data input:
	bits 0-4 -- keypressed value from the 74c923
	bit 5 - low = Shift pressed (Mon2 +)
	bit 6 - low = Key pressed - used by JMON with 4K7 resistor mod only
	bit 7 - not connected

Port 1 - 7-seg Display select & speaker (& JMON tape out) output
	bits 5-0 select seach 7-segment display, bit 5 = left, bit 0 = right
	bit 6 - not connected
	bit 7 - speaker output & tape output (tape --- JMON with DAT board only)

Port 2 - 7-seg segment select output
	bit 0	segment a
	bit 1	segment f
	bit 2	segment g
	bit 3	segment b
	bit 4	decimal point
	bit 5	segment c
	bit 6	segment e
	bit 7	segment d

Segments are defined as per the FND-500 7-segment display specification.
	
Port 3 - DAT board serial/inputs/keypresss sense/tape input
	bit 0	serial input
	bit 1	IN port 1
	bit 2	IN port 2
	bit 3	IN port 3
	bit 4	IN port 4
	bit 5	IN port 5
	bit 6	Keypress sense - LOW = a 74c923 key is being pressed
	bit 7	Casette input

Port 4 - DAT board LCD control port output

	As per the HD44780 16x2 LCD Spec - Instruction Register

Ports 5/6/7 - uncommitted

Port 84h - JMON/DAT board LCD data port input/output

	As per the HD44780 16x2 LCD Spec - Data Register

In JMON, the LCD picks up A7 as the 'register select' line, hence the port 04h/84h mapping.



TEC-1 I/O Address Space & Expansion

In a standard TEC only 8 I/O ports are decoded, so the I/O space 'wraps' every 8 ports. Adding A3 to pin 5 of the 74ls138 (disconnect pin 5 from GND and connect to A3 instead) expands this to 16 ports.

To decode ports 8-15, add another 74ls138, wired exactly as per the existing, except connect A3 to pin 6 instead of +5v & Keep pin 5 Grounded).

For >16 ports, A4 could also be used if needed to decode up to 32 ports. Connect A4 to pin 6 via an inverter to the first two 74ls138's, add two more 74ls138's and connect A4 directly (not inverted) to the second two '138's on pin 6 also. (Disconnect pin 6 from +5v on all 4 chips).


For Southern Cross SC-1:
Ports 80h to 83h - uncommitted - availalbe on expansion connector
Port 84h - 7-seg segment select output
Port 85h - 7-seg Display select & speaker (& JMON tape out) output
Port 86h - Keyboard data input
Port 87h - ???


Note that the SC-1 has the keyboard and 7-segment ports in a different order compared to the TEC.

The SC-1 decodes Address lines A6 and A7 for I/O meaning it has the ability to expand to 32 I/O ports - ranges 40h-4Fh and 80h to 8Fh. The onboard 74hc138 decodes 80h to 87h.

Note the SC-1's address model conflicts with the DAT board's use of 84h, meaning you cant fit a TEC/JMON type LCD to the SC-1 and use JMON in it without additional code rewrites. To fix this, use a different address line instead of A7 - e.g. use of A6 on the DAT board would put the LCD at 04h/44h.
